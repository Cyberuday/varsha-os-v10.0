<h1>🛠️ Technical Architecture</h1>
<h2>1. Frontend Layer (index.php)</h2>

Handles the 1200+ lines of UI logic, CSS glassmorphism, and the windowing engine. It manages the state of all open applications and simulated tool outputs.
<h2>2. Kernel Layer (kernel.php)</h2>

Acts as the bridge between the web interface and the server's OS. It sanitizes inputs and executes real shell commands while providing a fallback "Offline Mode" if connection is lost.
<h2>3. Tools Engine</h2>

A proprietary JavaScript object that mimics the output of complex hacking tools, allowing users to experience a "live" hacking environment without heavy server overhead.
